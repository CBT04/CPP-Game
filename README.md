# CPP-Game

I was interested in programming using one of the C langauges and decided on C++ due to my interest in video games. Building on the tutorial provided by Dan Zaidan on Youtube: ([watch here](https://youtu.be/luuyjjOxnUI?feature=shared)), I learned the basic syntax of C++ as well as mid-level programming concepts that were new to me such as pointers and memory allocation.

This project is a basic game which was developed to run on Windows using the WINAPI. Future improvements to this project could include developing compatibility layers for LINUX and MACOS.
