# CPP-Game

I was interested in programming using one of the C langauges and decided on C++ due to my interest in video games. Building on the tutorial provided by Dan Zaidan on Youtube: https://youtu.be/luuyjjOxnUI?feature=shared, I learned the basic syntax of C++, developing an application for windows as well as programming concepts that were new to me such as pointers.
