# CPP-Game

I was interested in programming using one of the C langauges and decided on C++ due to my interest in video games. Building on the tutorial provided by Dan Zaidan on Youtube ([watch here](https://youtu.be/luuyjjOxnUI?feature=shared)), I learned the basic syntax of C++ as well as mid-level programming concepts that were new to me such as pointers and memory allocation.

This project is a basic platformer game which was developed to run on Windows using the WINAPI.

## Project Files

* game.cpp - Contains the game logic such as physics and collision.
* platform_common.cpp - Contains structures to be used across several files.
* render_file.cpp - Contains functions to render shapes to the screen.
* utility.cpp - Utility functions such as clamp.
* win32_platform.cpp - Windows compatibility layer for the game.
